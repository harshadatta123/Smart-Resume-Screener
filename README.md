# Smart-Resume-Screener
### Project Overview
The Smart Resume Screener is a powerful, AI-driven application designed to streamline the candidate shortlisting process. It allows HR professionals and recruiters to upload multiple resumes (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) and a Job Description (JD), then intelligently score and rank candidates based on their fit for the role using Google's Gemini models.

The application calculates a final match score by combining two key metrics:

1.  **Semantic Similarity**: A score based on the embedding similarity between the candidate's core profile and the Job Description.

2.  **Composite Score Calculation**: Combines embedding-based similarity and LLM-based score using a weighted formula:

       **Final Score= (w × Embedding Similarity) + ((1−w) × (LLM Score/100​))**
    
     ### where:
       
       **Final Score** — Combined match score between resume and job description (0–1, later shown as %).
       
       **w** — Weight (0–1) assigned to embedding similarity, set by the user.
        
       **Embedding Similarity** — Cosine similarity between job and resume embeddings (semantic closeness).
        
       **LLM Score** — Match percentage (0–100) generated by Gemini based on contextual relevance.
        
       **(1 − w)** — Complementary weight for the LLM-based score.
        
       **LLM Score / 100** — Normalized LLM score for consistency with cosine similarity.
   
4.  **LLM Match Score**: A percentage score and justification generated directly by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, providing an in-depth, contextual assessment.
   
5.  **Candidate Ranking and Storage**: Displays top candidates with interpretability metrics and stores shortlisted resumes and metadata locally.
    

The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface, ensuring an interactive and visually appealing experience.
### Architecture Diagram

The diagram below represents the high-level architecture of the **Resume Scanner system**. It shows how the Streamlit frontend, Gemini-powered processing modules, and local storage interact to extract resume data, generate embeddings, compute match scores, and produce shortlisted candidates.

### LLM prompts used:

### 1\. Resume Parsing Prompt

**Function:** call\_gemini\_extract\_structured(resume_text: str)

**Model Used:** gemini-flash-latest

**Purpose:** This prompt instructs the Gemini model to analyze a given resume text and extract structured information in JSON format. It converts unstructured textual resumes into well-defined data elements that can be programmatically processed for further evaluation.

**Prompt Text:**

```python
prompt = f"""
Parse this resume text and return JSON with:
- name, email, phone, summary
- skills (list)
- experience (list of {{title, company, start, end, bullets}})
- education (list of {{degree, institution, year}})
Resume:
\"\"\"{resume_text[:6000]}\"\"\""""
```

**Description:** The model is prompted to extract the candidate’s personal details, skills, work experience, and education history. The output is expected to be in a JSON structure containing clearly defined fields. This structured information is later used to evaluate the candidate’s suitability for a given job description.

### 2\. Candidate–Job Comparison Prompt

**Function:** gemini\_score\_candidate\_against\_job(candidate_struct: dict, job_desc: str)

**Model Used:** gemini-flash-latest

**Purpose:** This prompt requests the Gemini model to compare a candidate’s resume information with a given job description. The model should provide a match percentage and a concise justification for the evaluation.

**Prompt Text:**

```python
prompt = f"""
Compare the candidate resume with the job description and output JSON:
{{"match_percent": <0-100>, "justification": "<2-3 concise sentences>"}}
Resume:
\"\"\"{candidate_text}\"\"\" 
Job description:
\"\"\"{job_desc}\"\"\""""
```

**Description:** The model receives the combined text of the candidate’s summary, skills, and experience, along with the job description. It then produces a structured JSON response that includes:

*   **match\_percent**: a numerical value (0–100) indicating how closely the candidate fits the job requirements.
    
*   **justification**: a short textual explanation summarizing the reasoning behind the score.
    

This output serves as the LLM-based semantic evaluation component in the overall scoring system.

### 3\. Embedding Generation

**Function:** get\_gemini\_embedding(text: str)

**Model Used:** models/text-embedding-004

**Purpose:** This step generates vector embeddings for both the candidate’s resume and the job description. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling quantitative comparison using cosine similarity.

**Model Invocation:**

```python
result = genai.embed_content(model="models/text-embedding-004", content=text)
```

**Description:** The model transforms textual content into a high-dimensional numerical vector (embedding). Cosine similarity is then calculated between the resume embedding and the job description embedding to measure how semantically similar they are. This similarity score is combined with the LLM-based evaluation to produce the final composite match score.

### Features

*   **Multi-Format Resume Support**: Accepts and processes resumes in PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats.
    
*   **AI-Powered Parsing**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to extract structured data (name, email, phone, skills, experience, education) from unstructured resume text.

2.  Gemini API Key: You need a Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from Google AI Studio.
    

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/resume-scanner.git
cd resume-scanner
```

**Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # On Windows
```

**Step 3: Install Required Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If a requirements.txt file is not available, use:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
**Step 4: Configure the API Key**

1. Obtain a valid Google Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.

2. Create a .env file in the project root directory and add:
```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Running the Application**
1. Execute the following command in the project directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
2. Once the application launches, open the following address in your browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8501/
```

### How to Use

1.  Upload Resumes: Use the "Upload resumes" file uploader to select one or more PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.
    
2.  Paste Job Description: Copy and paste the full text of the Job Description into the provided text area.
    
3.  Adjust Settings (Optional): In the sidebar, you can:
    
    *   Set Top K shortlisted candidates (default is 5).
        
    *   Adjust the Weight for embedding similarity (default is 0.6). A higher value makes the score rely more on semantic topic matching, while a lower value relies more on the direct, contextual LLM assessment.
        
4.  Analyze: Click the "Analyze Resumes" button.
    
5.  View Results: The "Shortlisted Candidates" section will display the top-ranked candidates with their final score, core details (name, email, skills), and the Gemini Pro justification.
    
6.  Access Saved Files: The resumes and their full JSON metadata will be saved to the shortlisted\_resumes folder. You can also view and download the saved files directly from the Streamlit app under the "View Saved Resumes" section.
