# Smart-Resume-Screener
### Project Overview
The Smart Resume Screener is a powerful, AI-driven application designed to streamline the candidate shortlisting process. It allows HR professionals and recruiters to upload multiple resumes (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) and a Job Description (JD), then intelligently score and rank candidates based on their fit for the role using Google's Gemini models.

The application calculates a final match score by combining two key metrics:

1.  **Semantic Similarity**: A score based on the embedding similarity between the candidate's core profile and the Job Description.

2.  **Composite Score Calculation**: Combines embedding-based similarity and LLM-based score using a weighted formula:

       **Final Score= (w × Embedding Similarity) + ((1−w) × (LLM Score/100​))**
    
     ### where:
       
       **Final Score** — Combined match score between resume and job description (0–1, later shown as %).
       
       **w** — Weight (0–1) assigned to embedding similarity, set by the user.
        
       **Embedding Similarity** — Cosine similarity between job and resume embeddings (semantic closeness).
        
       **LLM Score** — Match percentage (0–100) generated by Gemini based on contextual relevance.
        
       **(1 − w)** — Complementary weight for the LLM-based score.
        
       **LLM Score / 100** — Normalized LLM score for consistency with cosine similarity.
   
4.  **LLM Match Score**: A percentage score and justification generated directly by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, providing an in-depth, contextual assessment.
   
5.  **Candidate Ranking and Storage**: Displays top candidates with interpretability metrics and stores shortlisted resumes and metadata locally.
    

The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface, ensuring an interactive and visually appealing experience.

### Features

*   **Multi-Format Resume Support**: Accepts and processes resumes in PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats.
    
*   **AI-Powered Parsing**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to extract structured data (name, email, phone, skills, experience, education) from unstructured resume text.
    
*   **Dual-Layer Scoring**: Calculates a weighted average final score based on both semantic (embedding) similarity and a direct LLM match assessment.
    
*   **Customizable Weighting**: Users can adjust the weight slider in the sidebar to prioritize either the semantic similarity or the LLM-generated score.
    
*   **Top K Shortlisting**: Automatically ranks candidates and displays the top K (configurable) performers.
    
*   **Automatic Saving**: Shortlisted resumes and their comprehensive metadata (scores, justification, parsed data) are automatically saved to a local shortlisted\_resumes directory.
    
*   **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit and custom CSS for a clean, modern user interface.
    

### Technology Stack

*   Backend & App Framework: Python
    
*   Web Framework: Streamlit
    
*   Large Language Model (LLM): Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-pro and models/text-embedding-004)
    
*   PDF Processing: PyPDF2
    
*   DOCX Processing: python-docx
    
*   Dependencies: dotenv, numpy, scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)
    

### Setup and Installation

**Prerequisites**

1.  Python: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    
2.  Gemini API Key: You need a Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from Google AI Studio.
    

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/resume-scanner.git
cd resume-scanner
```

**Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # On Windows
```

**Step 3: Install Required Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If a requirements.txt file is not available, use:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
**Step 4: Configure the API Key**

1. Obtain a valid Google Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.

2. Create a .env file in the project root directory and add:
```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Running the Application**
1. Execute the following command in the project directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
2. Once the application launches, open the following address in your browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8501/
```

### How to Use

1.  Upload Resumes: Use the "Upload resumes" file uploader to select one or more PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.
    
2.  Paste Job Description: Copy and paste the full text of the Job Description into the provided text area.
    
3.  Adjust Settings (Optional): In the sidebar, you can:
    
    *   Set Top K shortlisted candidates (default is 5).
        
    *   Adjust the Weight for embedding similarity (default is 0.6). A higher value makes the score rely more on semantic topic matching, while a lower value relies more on the direct, contextual LLM assessment.
        
4.  Analyze: Click the "Analyze Resumes" button.
    
5.  View Results: The "Shortlisted Candidates" section will display the top-ranked candidates with their final score, core details (name, email, skills), and the Gemini Pro justification.
    
6.  Access Saved Files: The resumes and their full JSON metadata will be saved to the shortlisted\_resumes folder. You can also view and download the saved files directly from the Streamlit app under the "View Saved Resumes" section.
